In order to get this working one needs to execute following steps:

1. start server with proper arguments - please refer to ./server --help 
e.g if you want to create a disk
python server.py -c cbc -f img1.img  --create

--create will overwrite the file with matching name 

later on if you want to simply mount a disk

python server.py -c cbc -f img1.img

2. load nbd driver 
	modprobe nbd

2. connect to the driver
	nbd-client localhost port_of_your_choice /dev/nbd0

3. mount the block device
	mount /dev/nbd0 mount_point_of_your_choice

Please have in mind that the program is implemented in python => its SLOW
so in order to get the fastest option ( and probably the most secure since it relies mostly on pycrypto)
use cbc encryption mode

SECURITY NOTICE:
as this program exports _unencrypted_ block device via sockets, please ensure 
that you are the _only_ person able to connect to the server ( so block it from the outside by firewall
and ensure that at that time you are the only one logged in)
